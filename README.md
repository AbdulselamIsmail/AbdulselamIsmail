## Hi there 👋

Hi there 👋, I'm Abdülselam İsmail

🚀 Aspiring SOC Analyst | Blue Team Enthusiast | Machine Learning Explorer

I’m passionate about cybersecurity, threat detection, and applied machine learning. Currently, I’m building hands-on skills in SOC operations, malware analysis, and blue team tools to prepare for my first cybersecurity role.

🔐 About Me
🎯 Goal:
  Become a SOC Analyst / Threat Hunter

📚 Background:
  Networking, operating systems, log analysis, and malware analysis basics

💻 Currently Learning:
  Threat detection & SIEM (Wazuh, Splunk)
  Malware analysis (static & dynamic)
  Machine Learning for security (phishing detection, anomaly detection)
  Blue Team practices & SOC workflows

🛠️ Side Project: A C# .NET password manager app with AES encryption & security features

🧪 Projects

Phishing URL Detection with ML 🕵️
Compared multiple ML models (K-NN, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, RF Regression).
→ Random Forest achieved 97% accuracy, proving most effective for phishing detection.

Malware Analysis Labs 🔬
Performed dynamic analysis with tools like Wireshark, FakeNet, Procmon, and Regshot to study malware behavior.

SOC Home Lab 🖥️
Built a home lab with VirtualBox + Wazuh to simulate real SOC workflows and practice log analysis, alert triage, and detection engineering.

Password Manager (C#) 🔑
Implemented AES encryption, master password, auto-lock/timeout, and “click to reveal” for secure credential storage.

⚡ Skills
Programming: Python, C#
Cybersecurity Tools: Wireshark, FakeNet, Procmon, Regshot, Splunk, Wazuh
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Jupyter
Other: Networking fundamentals, Windows/Linux system basics

🌱 What’s Next
Preparing for Cisco CyberOps Associate
Expanding malware analysis & detection engineering skills
Contributing to open-source security projects
